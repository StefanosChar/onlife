    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Onlife built the Onlife app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by Onlife at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
    <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use our Service.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. This may include, but is not limited to, access to your device's camera. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.</p>
    <p>The app uses the camera permission to allow you to capture photos or videos. These media files are stored locally on your device or in a cloud storage service if you explicitly choose to upload them. We do not access, share, or retain your photos, videos, or any other data from your camera.</p>
    
    <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
    <p>The app requires access to your device's camera to function properly. This access is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take photos or videos within the app.</li>
        <li>Provide you with camera-based features like scanning QR codes or taking profile pictures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The images and videos captured through the camera are stored locally on your device. We do not upload or share your camera data unless you explicitly choose to do so by sharing it through other apps or cloud services.</p>
    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> The camera is only activated when you choose to use the camera features within the app. We do not access your camera or photos outside of this process.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store any photos or videos taken using the app on our servers. All data created through the app (such as photos and videos) is stored locally on your device or on cloud services that you explicitly connect with (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox). We do not have access to your media files unless shared by you.</p>
    
    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information, including data generated through your device's camera, with any third-party services, except as described in this Privacy Policy or when required by law.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you. Links to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
